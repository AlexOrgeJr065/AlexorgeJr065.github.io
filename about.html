                                            - A <b> Web Developer </b> is a programmer or a coder who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, 
                                            the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically 
                                            use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, 
                                            and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side 
                                            applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both 
                                            (full-stack developer). A web content management system may be used to develop and maintain web applications.

                                            - I am currently a College student at Rizal Technological University which is at Barangka, Mandaluyong City. 
                                            I currently have a band named “Tanikala” whom of which I am a part of as a lead guitarist. 
                                            I am also making my own music in garageband which is what I often use to make music with. 
                                            I have an electric and acoustic guitar at home. Also, I have a piano and ukulele. 
                                            Another thing that I have are my rubik's cube collections. I currently own 12 different types of rubiks cube. 
                                            These include: Pyraminx, 3x3 rubiks cube, 3x3 concave cube, 3x3 mirror cube, 4x4 rubiks cube, 5x5 rubiks cube, 
                                            square-1, rhombus, megaminx, skewb, fisher skewb, & windmill cube.

                                            - For what I do when there are no classes or on the weekends, what I would do is play online games wth my friends. 
                                            We sometimes play Roblox or Minecraft. In the past, we used to play Terraria. Or what I would do is play with my 
                                            musical instruments and just learn different songs that I love listening to what I want to play.
                                        </p>

                                            - My dream is to become a future Web Developer. It can be front-end, back-end, or full stack, whichever I can do. 
                                            I like to make websites for coding a website for me it is a bit satisfying when I have done something that I can 
                                            say I made this. My other dream is to become a full time guitar player of my band.
