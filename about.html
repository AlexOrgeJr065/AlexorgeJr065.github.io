                                            - A <b> Web Developer </b> is a programmer or a coder who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, 
                                            the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically 
                                            use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, 
                                            and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side 
                                            applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both 
                                            (full-stack developer). A web content management system may be used to develop and maintain web applications.

                                            - A Graphic Designer is a professional within the graphic design and graphic arts industry who assembles 
                                            together images, typography, or motion graphics to create a piece of design. A graphic designer creates the 
                                            graphics primarily for published, printed, or electronic media, such as brochures and advertising. They are also 
                                            sometimes responsible for typesetting, illustration, user interfaces. A core responsibility of the designer's job 
                                            is to present information in a way that is both accessible and memorable.

                                            - I am currently a College student at Rizal Technological University which is at Barangka, Mandaluyong City. 
                                            I currently have a band named “Tanikala” whom of which I am a part of as a lead guitarist. 
                                            I am also making my own music in garageband which is what I often use to make music with. 
                                            I have an electric and acoustic guitar at home. Also, I have a piano and ukulele. 
                                            Another thing that I have are my rubik's cube collections. I currently own 12 different types of rubiks cube.

                                            - For what I do when there are no classes or on the weekends, what I would do is play online games with my friends. 
                                            Also, I edit photos and make posters in Photoshop just to expand my creativity and learn more in using Photoshop.
                                            Another thing that I do is play my guitar. I play songs that I enjoy and want to play.

                                            - My dream is to become a future Web Developer. It can be front-end, back-end, or full stack, whichever I can do. 
                                            I like to make websites for coding a website for me it is a bit satisfying when I have done something that I can 
                                            say I made this. My other dream is to become a full time guitar player of my band. Also, I can go as a graphic designer
                                            in which I like to edit photos and make posters nowadays.
